First, the plan is to secure the web app. When opening localhost:5200/tictactoe, there is no security and it should be locked behind authentication (for testing purposes).

Then, I will start learning about classes of authentication and web apps, then make definitions and lists here

    Notes from 1/8 meeting:
-Focus on definitions of classes of web apps
-may not be React, could be HTML or PHP instead. React is not the whole picture. We want one app to represent the general
-Modern web apps have 2 classes: SPA and Next.js; understand the difference between the 2, might be where the rendering happens (client/server sides).
-JWT is used for distributed app (different parts from different servers). It is just the token.

JWT vs session cookie: major difference. JWT is more modern, session is classical. Same purpose, different implementations. JWT have a refresh and active token. In JWT, the server does not need to keep session/state info in the database. Makes it more flexible.
These answers will dictate which sample to choose for representative case.

In the web app, there is nothing stopping the user from going straight to tictactoe. No security for the app, needs a token system (session cookie or JWT). First focus is to make the app secure.
When I am learning/changing something big, take notes. Especially on roadblocks.

look for projects with licenses in readme -> ask chatgpt about projects we can use. Look at creative commons or GPL licenses. Usually must acknowledge source.

can make a list of sample projects (or web apps in general) of each class type, and note characteristics. Mostly focus on gaining a clear understanding so that my selection is good, so it is a representative set. Also need to talk about this in the paper, will be informative. Know characteristics.


    Updates:
    1/9/26: 
-Refactored URL system to have a default landing page, then passkey login is behind /login and tictactoe remains the same
-Also added "protected routes" and an isAuthenticated flag that is passed and updated on the backend.
-With these changes, I believe the /tictactoe page is better protected. Need to do more testing to see if it is 100% secure
My next goal is to implement a session token or JWT system to preserve login info for a short period of time

    1/14: 
-got new laptop, transferred system over and got MYSQL updated and working here as well
    1/15:
-started with improving the old system to give a JWT token, for session perserverance. Uses the JsonWebToken library, and saves it in local storage on frontend and database on backend
-the JWT library works well with webauthn, so very few issues
-Note that this particular JWT token system is based on a secret key that is kept on the backend, that needs changed before "deployment"
-On Frontend, it just adds a request to the backend upon loading to verify the token




    New command for building/deployment:
//this script builds frontend and copies build files into backend automatically:
npm run deploy 
//Then just start the backend:
npm run start-backend
